# NIE_Enzyme_Model_Shared
It's a model of COMSOL Multiphysics we illustrated in the paper 
This repo contains the model files and corresponding Livelink matlab script with the random walk script for the enzyme and electrode surface distance calculation.

## Installation 

Please make sure you have the following modules available in your COMSOL Multiphysics:
``` Chemical Species Transport
    Mathematics
    Livelink for MATLAB
```
## To start in COMSOL Multiphysics
You can directly open the .mph file in COMSOL Multiphysics of folder /Comsol, the model is default set for catalase. If you want to change the enzyme, please change the parameters in the model accordingly.
## Basic parameter setting
You can check the description in paper for the detail of the geometry.
